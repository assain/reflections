When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In cases where you'd want to collaborate with others by sharing your repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You don't want to sync both all the time. for e.g. you might have broken 
    some features, which immediately get synced and breaks the remote too.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: creating a clone of a repo that belongs to a user to your github account.
    Saves the hassle of cloning to your local repo and then pushing into your account.

    Clone: create a copy of a repo, either locally or remotely.

    Branches: To experiment, to add new features, fix bugs etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You get to know that the branch has changed. You can get the remote changes 
    updated from that point and have them merged with the local repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without github, having a repo which everyone could use, make changes and provide
    feedback would have been painstaking for e.g. accessing remote computers and sending
    emails communicating changes. 

    It would be harder to propose new features using pull requests and getting feedback on it
    and commiting changes to fix anything.

    Besides without git, version controlling and managing files would have been harder to
    do by keeping track of things manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
